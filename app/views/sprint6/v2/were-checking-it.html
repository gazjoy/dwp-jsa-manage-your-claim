        <p>Dear ((first name))</p>
        
        <p>We’re processing your New Style JSA application.</p>

        <p>If we have any questions about the details you’ve provided, we’ll let you know. If we do not have any questions, 
        the next time we contact you will be to set up an appointment to discuss your job search. The appointment is for you 
        to talk through the steps you can take to get a job.</p>

        <p>If you’re not eligible, you should receive a letter within a week.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can do next</h2>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>make a record of the job sites you have registered on</li>
            <li>make sure you’ve uploaded your latest CV</li>
            <li>let us know if your circumstances change, for example if you get a job</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you need financial support</h2>
        
        <p>If you need help with bills or other costs while we look at your application, 
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/eligibility">check if you can get Universal Credit</a>. 
        If you’re eligible, you could:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>get Universal Credit at the same time or instead of New Style JSA</li>
          <li>apply for an advance payment</li>
        </ul>
