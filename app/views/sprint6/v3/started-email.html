        <p>Dear ((first name))</p>

        <p>We’re processing your New Style JSA application.</p>

        <p>If we have any questions about the details you’ve provided, we’ll let you know.</p>

        <p>If you can get New Style JSA, we’ll usually contact you within 7 days to set up an 
        appointment to discuss your job search. The appointment will be over the phone and is 
        for you to talk through the things you can do to get a job.</p>

        <p>If you cannot get New Style JSA, we’ll usually send you a letter within 7 days to explain why.</p>
        
        <p>We’re getting a high number of applications due to coronavirus. We’re working hard to process your 
        application as soon as we can.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Do you need help with housing costs or support for a partner or child?</h2>

        <p>If you’re on a low income you might be able to apply for Universal Credit as part of a dual claim with New Style JSA.</p>
        <p>Unlike New Style JSA, you can apply with a partner and get support for housing costs, children and childcare.</p>
        <p>You or your partner must have less than £16,000 in savings or investments to be eligible.</p>
        <p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-claim-universal-credit">how to claim Universal Credit on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can do next</h2>

        <p>While we process your application, you should:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>make a record of the jobsites you’ve registered on</li>
          <li>make sure you’ve uploaded your latest CV to jobsites</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances">let us know if your circumstances change</a>, for example if you get a job</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><a href="#">Tell us about your experience of New Style JSA.</a></p>
