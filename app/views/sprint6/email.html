<p>Dear ((first name)) ((last name))</p>

<p>You’ve submitted your New Style Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) application.</p>

<p>You submitted your application on: ((claimSubmittedDate))</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

<p>We’ll check to make sure you’re eligible for New Style JSA.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re eligible</h3>

<p>If we decide you’re eligible, we’ll contact you about an appointment to agree your claimant commitment, usually within 10 
working days. The appointment will normally be over the phone.</p>

<p>You’ll usually get your first payment within 5 working days of your appointment. We cannot pay you unless you attend the 
appointment.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Support during the appointment</h2>

<p>If you need support during the appointment, you can have another person with you.</p>

<p>If you need a foreign language interpreter, you’ll need someone with you who can help with interpretation. We do not 
normally provide interpretation services.</p>

<p>Contact Jobcentre Plus before your appointment if you have a disability or health condition, for example a hearing 
impairment, which means you cannot attend a phone interview.</p>
