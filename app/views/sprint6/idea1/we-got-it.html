        <p>Dear ((first name))</p>

        <p>We recently received your application, and we need to check the details you've sent us. 
        This usually takes us about 10 working days.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can do next</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>take some time to check your CV reflects all your experience and skills</li>
            <li>register on job sites, especially ones that have relevant work in your field</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances">let us know if you find a new job</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you are unable to wait for funds</h2>
        <p>Check if you are eligible to apply for Universal Credit, a sum could be released early which is taken off future payments.</p>
